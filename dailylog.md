Word Done: Evalaute all the assignment topic and did a small research about it. <br>

Word Done: Start working on my choose assignment that is Outfit photo to wardrobe matching. I did an in-depth search for the available clothing and fashion dataset available for this task and study in this dataset. I analyze the dataset for their size and quality and the bounding box co-ordinate file available is fit for what types of algorithms. <br>

Time Spent: 90 mins <br>
Word Done: To take inspiration and understand the process of execution, I take a look at exactingly available projects related to clothing and fashion tasks. I also study Siamese networks and other methods and architecture for finding similarity score. Than then I spend sparse time on presentation creation. <br>

Time Spent: 90 mins <br>
Work Spent: I take a look at Tensorflow object detection zoo and also object detection architectures available at Pytorch. As this is a business problem, I narrow my focus to architectures that balance both the terms, i.e., time and accuracy. I created my Github repo for this assignment. I presented by presentation. <br>

Time Spent: 120 min <br>
Work Spent: Label and draw bouding box to create dataset for yolov5. Also spend time on investigating dataset for sesame network. Find difficulties and error in dataset. <br>

Date: 19 July 2021 <br>
Time Spent: 5 hrs <br>
Work Spent: Recreated the dataset again, draw boudning boxes over 650 plus images with YoloLabel tool, along with that preprocess the data and organize it for YoloV5<br>

Time Spent: 7 hrs<br>
Work Spent: Its 1:00am of 21 July, morning, and I finally finished with the project. I search various datasets for seimes network. Spend some time understanding and reading how to create seimes network. Spent good number of hours in implementing seimes network but does not find any success there for finally get settle on structural similarity index measure. Than after I spent most of time writing code to perform object detection with yolov5, solving its error and than writing the logical code that will function the wardrobe and again solving the errors. <br>
