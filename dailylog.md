Word Done: Start working on my choose assignment that is Outfit photo to wardrobe matching. I did an in-depth search for the available clothing and fashion dataset available for this task and study in this dataset. I analyze the dataset for their size and quality and the bounding box co-ordinate file available is fit for what types of algorithms.

Word Done: To take inspiration and understand the process of execution, I take a look at exactingly available projects related to clothing and fashion tasks. I also study Siamese networks and other methods and architecture for finding similarity score. Than then I spend sparse time on presentation creation.

Work Spent: I take a look at Tensorflow object detection zoo and also object detection architectures available at Pytorch. As this is a business problem, I narrow my focus to architectures that balance both the terms, i.e., time and accuracy. I created my Github repo for this assignment. And I get closer to finishing my presentation.
